You need to translate it to systemdspeak. 
Code:
# eth interfaces for firewall 
# we don't want them getting IP addresses 
# as they are being donated to bridges 

config_eth0="null" 
config_eth1="null" 
config_eth2="null" 
config_eth3="null" 
config_eth4="null" 

bridge_br0="eth1" 

# the DMZ 
bridge_br1="eth2" 
config_br1="192.168.10.254/24" 
# wireless 
bridge_br2="eth3" 
config_br2="192.168.54.254/24" 
# protected wired 
bridge_br3="eth4" 
config_br3="192.168.100.254/24"

This is all on the host. I've left out the routing things. 

When you create your guest in libvirtd, it will show you the bridges to connect the network too. 

I have donated real hardware to the bridges but thats not required. 
You can route a range of addresses to a bridge with no hardware on the host too. That works.
